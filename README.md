# Ultimate-Dynamic-Employees-or-Students-Register
This attendance register is so simple and dynamic it can be a good fit to any project looking to record attendance, what it does is that it displays all the days of that particular month and employees or students and you just have to check or tick the day corresponding to the student or applicant when finish you just have to hit save that’s all if we are in December it will display all the days in December if you’re in January it will automatically switch to January etc. that’s y it is so good and I have decided to share so that you can make your system awesome and save time developing or searching for registers.
